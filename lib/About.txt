This program was built on Python 3.9.4, and made heavy use of the following Open Source modules:
- Colour 0.3.16 - https://www.colour-science.org/ : for calculating the color coordinates on the CIE 1931 color space and RGB
- Matplotlib 3.4.1 - https://matplotlib.org/ : for plotting the Chromaticity Diagram and the spectral distributions
- XlsxWriter 1.4.3 - https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/ : for exporting the color coordinates to Microsoft Excel
- Tkinter (Tcl/Tk 8.6) - https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html : for creating the graphical user interface
- cx_Freeze 6.6 - https://pypi.org/project/cx-Freeze/ : for exporting the program to a Windows executable
