New features:
Drag and drop files on window or on program executable
Point highlighting on mouse over
Database to store results
Editing name of spectra
Multi threading to speed up spectra processing and plotting

Fixes:
Tweak the Error log folder location
Make the logging to begin as soon as the program starts, so messages before the window is open get logged.
Force focus on Help/About windows
SVG program icon (Linux)
Maybe I can make the "open file" dialog on Linux to accept multiple file extensions for a file if I use commas to separate the extensions.
